WHAT

  The specification of a streamable binary dump format for SQLite3
  databases as well as reference code for producing and consuming such
  dumps.  No effort has been expended on making the code compatible with
  non-POSIX systems.

WHY

  Compared to the textual dumps produced and consumed by the sqlite3 shell,
  binary dumps are smaller and can be read faster.  (Writing them takes
  about the same amount of time.)

  The SQLite3 principle of text validation is "garbage in, garbage out".
  Garbage entered in UTF-16 mode can't be losslessly extracted in UTF-8
  mode and vice versa.  The database file gigo.sqlite is included as an
  example of this.  pragma integrity_check reports no errors, but the
  shell's .dump command produces output that causes errors if you try to
  load it into a new database.

HOW

  The included Makefile should work with either GCC or Clang on POSIX-like
  systems.  It builds two executables (s3bdstore, s3bdload) and a static
  library (libs3bd.a).
